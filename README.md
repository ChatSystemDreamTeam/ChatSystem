ChatSystem
==========

A simple but nice ChatSystem

##Importation

*If you don't know Git* Here is how to import the project on your computer :

Go to your workspace and write this command in the terminal : `git clone https://github.com/ChatSystemDreamTeam/ChatSystem.git`

You now have the project and can see the sources, congrats !

To update the repository on your computer with the online changes, you only have to launch - from the repo - `git pull` 

Note for INSA students : You may have some issues cloning the repositorie behind the proxy. To solve that, use this command `export http_proxy=wwwcache.insa-toulouse.fr:3128`
##How Does It Works ?

The application gives you the opportunity to communicate with a friend of yours on your local network !

There is a lot of fantastic options like :

* Send a Message
* Send a File
* Receive a Message
* Receive a File
* Talk to your Mom (if she is on the same network than you)
* Use your OWN Nickname !
* Launch the application
* Quit the Application
